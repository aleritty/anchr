## üóí Description
The idea arose when someday I considered it useful to have a collection of web links or bookmarks ‚Äì like those you have in Chrome or Firefox ‚Äì accessible from anywhere without needing to synchronize your browser profile. Just like if you‚Äôre somewhere on another PC, find a useful article on the internet and want to save it quickly for later at home. This is what Anchr‚Äôs __collections__ feature does. It saves links ‚Äì with an optional description for easier search and separated into categories / collections.

The second feature is to __upload images__. You can easily upload one or more photos from your computer or mobile device and send them to friends or include them into forum posts or the like. Special with Anchr‚Äôs image hosting is that users are given the opportunity to client-sided encrypt images with a password. As a result no one without the password will ever see their photos‚Äô content.

The last feature are __shortlinks__ ‚Äì actually not any different from those you know from goo.gl or bit.ly. They‚Äôre useful if you have a very long web link including many query parameters, access tokens, session ids, special characters and the like and want to share them. Often special characters break the linking or your chat application has a maximum length for hyperlinks. Or you just want to keep clarity in your document or emails. In this case it can be very helpful to make the links as short as any possible. Additionally, shortlinks are checked against [Google's Safe Browsing API](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/) to prevent your site to reference phishing sites or the like.

Anchr‚Äôs focus is on ease and quickness of use ‚Äì short loading times, flat menu hierarchies, etc. There's also a Chrome extension out there, which you can use to save or shorten links directly from the website.

## üß∞ Tooling
### [ShareX](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX) (Windows only)
You can integrate Anchr with [ShareX](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX) on Windows and make it be used as a custom target for **image uploads** and **shortlinks**.
1. Generate an HTTP basic auth hash Base64 hash of `youremail@example.org:yourpassword`
    * **Option 1 (Linux):** `echo "youremail@example.org:yourpassword" | base64`
    * **Option 2:** Use an [online tool](https://www.base64encode.net/)
1. Insert your newly generated hash in
    * [`sharex-images.json`](scripts/sharex-images.json) and
    * [`sharex-shortlinks.json`](scripts/sharex-shortlinks.json)
1. Import both files as custom uploaders in ShareX

## üß© Project History
The project's origins lie in 2014, back when the [MEAN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mean-stack) was the sh*t. It was the author's first real web project and a great opportunity to learn. The project is maintained ever since, however, considered mostly feature-complete. Dependencies are updated occasionally. Because the project started quite a couple of years ago, some parts are still based on old-fashioned JavaScript ES5 syntax, alongside vintage tools like [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](https://bower.io/). Certainly, this is not state-of-the-art in web dev anymore. However, to keep consistency with existing code, the original code style should still be followed in new contributions. **Update:** Just [recently](https://github.com/muety/anchr/issues/54), all backend-side code was refactored to modern JavaScript syntax to ease development.
